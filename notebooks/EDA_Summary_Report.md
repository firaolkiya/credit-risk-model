|------------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| transport | 25 | 2 | 8.00% |
| utility_bill | 1,920 | 12 | 0.63% |
| financial_services | 45,405 | 161 | 0.35% |
| airtime | 45,027 | 18 | 0.04% |
| data_bundles | 1,613 | 0 | 0.00% |
| movies | 175 | 0 | 0.00% |
| other | 2 | 0 | 0.00% |
| ticket | 216 | 0 | 0.00% |
| tv | 1,279 | 0 | 0.00% |

### 3.3 Correlation Analysis

#### Strong Correlations
1. **Amount vs Value**: 0.99 (almost perfect correlation)
2. **Value vs FraudResult**: 0.57 (moderate positive correlation)
3. **Amount vs FraudResult**: 0.56 (moderate positive correlation)

#### Key Insight
Higher transaction values are associated with higher fraud risk, making transaction value a strong predictor for fraud detection.

### 3.4 Product Category Analysis

#### Most Popular Categories
1. **financial_services**: 45,405 transactions (47.5%)
2. **airtime**: 45,027 transactions (47.1%)
3. **utility_bill**: 1,920 transactions (2.0%)
4. **data_bundles**: 1,613 transactions (1.7%)
5. **tv**: 1,279 transactions (1.3%)

#### Risk Assessment by Category
- **High Risk**: transport (8% fraud rate)
- **Medium Risk**: utility_bill (0.63% fraud rate), financial_services (0.35% fraud rate)
- **Low Risk**: airtime (0.04% fraud rate)
- **No Risk**: data_bundles, movies, other, ticket, tv (0% fraud rate)

## 4. Top 5 Key Insights

### 1. **Customer Concentration Risk**
- One customer (AccountId_4841) has 30,893 transactions (32.3% of all transactions)
- Top 5 customers account for 43.8% of all transactions
- **Implication**: Need to handle customer concentration in risk modeling

### 2. **Transaction Value as Fraud Indicator**
- Fraudulent transactions average 1.5M UGX vs 3.6K UGX for legitimate transactions
- 423x higher average value for fraudulent transactions
- **Implication**: Transaction value is a critical fraud predictor

### 3. **Product Category Risk Stratification**
- Clear risk hierarchy: transport > utility_bill > financial_services > airtime
- Some categories (data_bundles, tv, movies) have zero fraud
- **Implication**: Product category should be a key feature in credit scoring

### 4. **Temporal Patterns**
- 90-day transaction period shows consistent daily patterns
- Multiple transactions per day suggest active user base
- **Implication**: Time-based features will be valuable for risk assessment

### 5. **Provider Distribution**
- ProviderId_4 (38,189 transactions) and ProviderId_6 (34,186 transactions) dominate
- **Implication**: Provider-specific risk patterns may exist

## 5. Recommendations for Feature Engineering

### 5.1 RFM Features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
1. **Recency**: Days since last transaction for each customer
2. **Frequency**: Number of transactions per customer (already calculated)
3. **Monetary**: Total amount spent, average transaction value, transaction value volatility

### 5.2 Risk Indicators
1. **Fraud History**: Previous fraud incidents per customer
2. **High-Value Transaction Ratio**: Percentage of transactions above certain thresholds
3. **Product Risk Score**: Weighted average of product category fraud rates
4. **Provider Risk Score**: Provider-specific fraud rates

### 5.3 Behavioral Features
1. **Transaction Patterns**: Time of day, day of week preferences
2. **Category Preferences**: Most purchased product categories
3. **Channel Usage**: Preferred payment channels
4. **Transaction Velocity**: Transactions per day/week

### 5.4 Temporal Features
1. **Seasonality**: Monthly and weekly patterns
2. **Growth Trends**: Increasing/decreasing transaction frequency
3. **Gap Analysis**: Time between transactions

## 6. Next Steps for Model Development

### 6.1 Proxy Variable Definition
Based on the analysis, recommend defining credit risk using:
- **FraudResult** as primary indicator
- **High-value transaction patterns** as secondary indicator
- **Product category risk scores** as tertiary indicator

### 6.2 Feature Selection Priority
1. **High Priority**: Transaction Value, Product Category, Fraud History
2. **Medium Priority**: Transaction Frequency, Provider, Channel
3. **Low Priority**: Time-based features, Customer demographics

### 6.3 Model Considerations
- **Class Imbalance**: Only 0.2% fraud rate requires special handling
- **Customer Concentration**: Need to account for heavy users
- **Feature Engineering**: Focus on RFM and risk-based features
- **Validation Strategy**: Time-based split recommended

## 7. Conclusion

The dataset provides a solid foundation for credit scoring model development with:
- **Excellent data quality** (no missing values or duplicates)
- **Clear fraud patterns** (value-based indicators)
- **Rich behavioral data** (RFM patterns, product preferences)
- **Temporal consistency** (90-day transaction history)

The analysis reveals that transaction value and product category are the strongest predictors of fraud risk, making them ideal candidates for the credit scoring model's feature set.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with model development focusing on value-based risk indicators and product category risk stratification.
