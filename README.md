📘 Credit Scoring Business Understanding
🔍 1. Basel II and the Need for Interpretability
The Basel II Accord emphasizes robust risk measurement, regulatory compliance, and capital adequacy, especially for credit risk models used by financial institutions. This regulatory framework mandates that models must not only be accurate but also interpretable and transparent to both auditors and stakeholders.

Because of this, our credit scoring model must prioritize:

Interpretability (e.g., using Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence encoding)

Auditability (every feature transformation must be traceable)

Reproducibility (via Git and DVC for full version control)

Models that cannot explain why a user is high or low risk may fail internal validation or external audits, leading to reputational or compliance risks.

🔧 2. Proxy Labeling: Why It’s Necessary and What It Risks
Since our dataset lacks a direct label for loan default, we must define a proxy variable — for example, whether the customer was involved in a fraudulent transaction. This proxy is used to train a supervised learning model.

Using a proxy is necessary to:

Enable supervised training

Capture behavioral patterns that signal risk

However, this approach brings risks:

Mismatch risk: Fraud does not always equal credit default

Bias: Proxies can introduce systematic errors (e.g., misclassifying reliable users)

Compliance: Proxies must be transparently documented and continuously monitored

To reduce these risks, our project includes thorough documentation, interpretable models, and strategies to validate the proxy's real-world reliability.

⚖️ 3. Model Trade-offs: Simplicity vs. Performance
Factor	Simple Model (Logistic Regression + WoE)	Complex Model (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
Interpretability	✅ High	❌ Low (needs SHAP or LIME)
Regulatory Compliance	✅ Easy to justify	⚠️ Requires post-hoc explanation
Performance (Accuracy, AUC)	❌ Moderate	✅ Often better
Deployment and Maintenance	✅ Simple and lightweight	⚠️ Resource-intensive
Stakeholder Trust	✅ Easy to explain	⚠️ May need extra training

In regulated industries, simple models are preferred for ease of governance and regulatory approval. Complex models can offer performance gains but must be paired with strong explainability and documentation tools to be viable.
